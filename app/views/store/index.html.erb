					[<b>NOTE:</b>  This cart app isn't fully functional, and that's on purpose.  The purpose of this app 
					is to demonstrate my capabilities as a web developer to put together a basic shopping cart app.  
					The items displayed below are for demonstration purposes only; this app will not ask for your credit 
					card info, nor will it ask for any info regarding a check or purchase order.  If my free time opens up 
					in the near future, I may change this app so that it is fully functional.  Until then, it's just a 
					neat display piece.  =P
				</p>
				<p>
					Feel free to play with this app!  It won't actually place a real order at this time, so do so with abandon!  
					If you'd actually like to commission me to make a whip for you, please go to the <a href="contact.html">Contacts</a> page and 
					send me a message.  I'll be in touch with you shortly to discuss what you'd like for me to make.]

				Perhaps you think that making a nylon whip looks too complicated to do on your own.  Or perhaps you just
				don't feel like exerting the effort to gather all of the materials and make one yourself.  Whatever the
				reason, I've got an alternative solution for you!  I can make a nylon whip for you!  See below for a few
				whips that I have made and ready for shipping.
