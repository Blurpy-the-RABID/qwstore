								<p>
									The art of whip cracking has been around for quite a long time.  In recent years whip cracking has been made 
									popular due to film and television.  Indiana Jones, Zorro, and Catwoman are just three popular characters 
									that come to most people's minds when they think about whip cracking.  Perhaps these characters have inspired 
									you to pursue the art of whip cracking.  But then you saw how much a standard leather or paracord whip will 
									cost, and you may become discouraged.
								</p>
								<p>
									Fear not!  There is a much cheaper and equally efficient way to get yourself a whip to practice with!  You 
									will find exactly what you need here at Quick Whips!  This site will show you how to make your own whip out 
									of nylon rope, which is easily found at your local hardware store.  This process takes very little time to 
									complete, so it won't take long for you to get to the fun part - actually cracking a whip!  If you're not 
									interested in making your own whip, then you may contact me so that I can do the work for you!

								<div class="textbox_header">Why Use A Nylon Whip?</div>
								<p>
									Using a simple whip made of nylon rope has several advantages for novice whip crackers and experts alike!  
									Here's a list of several valid reasons that anyone interested in whip cracking should consider before 
									purchasing their first whip:
									<ul>
										<li>Nylon whips require much less time to make than a traditional round-braided whip.</li>
										<li>Nylon whips require far less materials than a round-braided whip of equal (or even shorter) length.</li>
										<li>Nylon whips can be washed much more easily than a leather whip.</li>
										<li>Nylon whips can be dyed any color you wish!  Customize your whip's appearance and show it off with pride!</li>
										<li>Nylon is naturally more resistant to most harsh environmental conditions, so maintenance is almost 
											non-existent!</li>
										<li>If your nylon whip somehow gets destroyed or ruined, it's of little loss to you!  Just make a new one 
											and you're good to go!</li>
									</ul> 
								</p>

									Explore this site to learn more about what you'll need to create your very own nylon whip!  Be safe and have fun!
